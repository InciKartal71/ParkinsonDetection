## Introduction
I completed a study on the "Prediction of Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning." Through this research, I utilized advanced machine learning algorithms and achieved significant prediction accuracies. 

## Focus
This research investigates the relationship between age, genetic predisposition, and the likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), aiming to enhance diagnosis and treatment strategies. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons, predominantly affecting individuals over 60 years old. Genetic factors significantly influence susceptibility, with mutations like SNCA and LRRK2 playing pivotal roles.

The study employs supervised machine learning classification using speech signal features obtained from a dataset comprising 195 samples. These features, indicative of vocal abnormalities associated with PD, are crucial for early risk assessment. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier models were trained and evaluated on their ability to classify PD risk.

Key findings indicate that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed others with an accuracy of 89.74%, demonstrating robustness in distinguishing PD cases. In contrast, Logistic Regression struggled with a 67% accuracy, primarily due to its linear nature and dataset complexity. The Decision Tree Classifier achieved 74.36% accuracy but exhibited limitations in recalling non-Parkinson’s cases.

This research underscores the importance of age and genetic markers in PD risk assessment and proposes tailored diagnostic approaches. Future studies should explore larger datasets and advanced modeling techniques to refine diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early intervention strategies for Parkinson’s disease.
